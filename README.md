Advanced CSS Portfolio 

# User Story

As An employer
I want to view a potential employee's portfolio of coding examples
SO THAT I can review their work and determine whether they would make a good fit for the company. 

# Description

I needed to produce my own portfolio website from scratch. I first started with the base HTML. Once the website was given its content and strcture, I added styling via CSS. The website has some basic information in my about me section as well as a few ways of contacting me. Eventually the website will include all of my coding projects as well as a in depth resume.
